#Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm

I wanted to learn a Haskell without doing any great amount of good, so I
decided to try my hand at a random cryptographic algorithm. [Shamir's Secret
Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing) was just what
the doctor ordered. This is one of the first things I ever wrote in Haskell,
and probably the first non-trivial work.

I ended up learning a lot about groups and rings and galois fields (oh my)
through this, but it's been so long since I touched it and it's so lacking in
comments that I'm afraid to dive back in.
